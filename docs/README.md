# Dscript Overview

Dscript is a small scripting language intended for plugâ€‘in style extensions in Dart applications. At the moment the package ships with a parser and static analyzer. A runtime engine is planned but not yet available.

This guide covers the language syntax and how to integrate scripts with a Dart host. Sections marked as **Work in Progress** describe features that are not implemented in the current version.
