# Dscript

Welcome to the documentation for **Dscript**, a small DSL (Domain-Specific Language) designed to let you write “plugin” scripts that integrate seamlessly with a Dart/Flutter host.  
Here you’ll find:

- **Using the Language**: How to write `.dscript` files, DSL syntax, built-in types, and examples.
- **Contracts & Dart**: How to define a contract in Dart, load and run a script at runtime, and bind host functions.

> If you’re already comfortable with the language, jump to [Defining Contracts](contracts-dart/defining-contracts.md) to learn how to bridge your Dart code to Dscript.  
> Otherwise, start at [Introduction](using-language/introduction.md).
